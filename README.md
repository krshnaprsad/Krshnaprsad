Got it! Here’s a funnier and more fitting GitHub bio for you as a developer + artist:


---

🎨💻 Hi, I’m Krishna Prasad!

🚀 Multimedia Designer | Amateur Developer | Professional Overthinker
🎭 Code + Art = Creative Chaos
💡 Philosophy: 
(
If it looks good, it's intentional. If it breaks, it’s modern art.
)
🔍 Debugging: Like fixing a painting… except the brush yells "SyntaxError" at me.

📌 How I Work:

Code: Structured, precise, (mostly).

Design: Abstract, expressive, (intentionally messy).

Git commits: A mix of "fixed everything", "broke everything", and "why did this work?"


🎨 Fun fact: I refactor my code like I refine my sketches—over and over until it feels right.
